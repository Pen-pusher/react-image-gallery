# React Image Gallery
An [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) collection and photo viewer built with React. 

## About
While I was learning React.js, I was looking for something to do to test my React knowledge. So I came up with the idea of making an online album kinda like Google Photo. You can browse through Unsplash’s photo collections and view hight quality photos in an easy-to-use slides UI.

This project uses Material Design as its design language. Supports RWD and IE 11.
